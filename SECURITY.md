## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously in the VIEWS Forecast API project. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report via:
   - Email to project maintainers (see README for contacts)
   - Or create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. Include in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Every week until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: Critical issues within 30 days

## Security Best Practices

When using or contributing to this API:

### API Keys
- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### Data Protection
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate query parameters
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production environments

### Dependencies
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regularly run security audits: `pip audit`
- Review dependency licenses
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities

### Deployment
- Use secure defaults in configuration
- Enable CORS appropriately
- Implement proper authentication
- Use security headers
- Regular security scans

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementations
- API key authentication (when configured)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection (no direct SQL queries)
- XSS protection through proper content types

### Planned Improvements
- OAuth 2.0 support
- Rate limiting per API key
- Request signing
- Audit logging
- Encrypted data at rest

## Responsible Disclosure

We support responsible disclosure. Security researchers who follow this policy will be:
- Acknowledged in security advisories
- Added to our Hall of Fame (if desired)
- Not pursued legally for their findings

## Contact

For sensitive security issues, contact the maintainers directly:
- See README.md for current maintainer contacts
- Use encrypted communication when possible
